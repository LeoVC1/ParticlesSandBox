# Particles Sandbox
Personal project in Unity3D using High Definition Render Pipeline, to develop shader and particles and study new content of HDRP like Visual Effects Graph.

I opened this project to study about particles when I bought a Udemy course by Gabriel Aguiar on Particle System in Unity, since then I am passionate about the development of VFX and Shader
