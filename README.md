# Particles Sandbox
Personal project in Unity3D using High Definition Render Pipeline, to develop shader and particles and study new content of HDRP like Visual Effects Graph.

I opened up this project to study about particles when I bought a Udemy course from Gabriel Aguiar about Particle System in Unity,
since that I am in love with VFX and Shader development
